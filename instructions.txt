Instructions to run the chit passing app
Prrequisites:
Apache,PHP,MySql installed (I have assumed no password
In case of password, go to helpers.php and type in your password at line 24, assigning to $password)

1) Copy the entire code base to the Apache www directory under a folder called chits
2) Create the database called mun in MySql
3) Run the creation statements given in creation.sql ( do not run file, as it has certain comments also. Copy paste statements)
4) Populate the table using the statements given in seed.sql 
5) Start the server
URLs:
localhost/chits/index.php: Landing page . Authenticates the user.
localhost/chits/home.php: Home page of a logged in user
localhost/chits/eb/index.php: Login page of EB
localhost/chits/eb/home.php : Home page of EB
localhost/chits/admin/index.php : Login page of admin ie for people to add users on the day. Authentication has been hard coded in auth.php
localhost/chits/admin/home.php : Home page of admin. Allows the admin to add users. (not extended for multiple councils.)

TO DO:
1) Adding reply button
2) Adding the GSL extension
3) Changing the password generation for users, taking the MUN ID into account. Currently using DOB, which isnt available.
4) Changing all pages to accomodate all the councils
